# Stake Shift

Code to perform Stake Shift computation on the Litecoin blockchain. The project also contains the code to perform the comparison of Address Linking Heuristics.

The code uses the [BlockSci tool v0.3.0](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci) for the parsing of the Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchain, as well as for the clustering of addresses.

More specifically, the Heuristic Comparison.ipynb is an IPython Notebook which contains the code used to compare the different proposed heuristics on the Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchain.

The Litecoin Stake Shift.ipynb is an IPython Notebook which contains all the code related to the experiments done on the Litecoin blockchain.

The ltc_block_sh, ltc_block_sh_2, ltc_block_sh_3, ltc_block_sh_4 files contain some saved statistical distances used in the code.
